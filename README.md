# S\textsuperscript{2}OD-Net: Spectral-Spatial Orthogonal Decoupling Network for Unsupervised 3D Medical Image Registration


##  Introduction

The official implementation of S\textsuperscript{2}OD-Net.

###  News
*   **[2026-01-01]** The paper is currently under review. The code and pretrained models will be released **immediately upon acceptance**.

## Dataset
The official access addresses of the public data sets are as follows：

LPBA [[link]](https://resource.loni.usc.edu/resources/atlases-downloads/) 

OASIS, We use the preprocessed OASIS dataset provided by TransMorph. You can download the data and pre-trained models here: [TransMorph on OASIS](https://github.com/junyuchen245/TransMorph_Transformer_for_Medical_Image_Registration/blob/main/OASIS/TransMorph_on_OASIS.md)

IXI [[link]](https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/pub/data/) [[freesurfer link]](https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/pub/data/ixi/)

Note that we use the processed IXI dataset provided by freesurfer.


### 🖼️ Architecture

> The architecture of S²OD-Net. It features a dual-stream encoder and a recursive decoder integrated with CFSA and LSConv3D modules.

###  Coming Soon
The full source code, including:
- [ ] Data preprocessing scripts
- [ ] Training and inference codes
- [ ] Pre-trained weights for IXI, LPBA, and OASIS
- [ ] Evaluation metrics

...will be made publicly available here after the paper is accepted.
